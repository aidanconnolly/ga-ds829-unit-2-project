## Project Objective

For project two, you will complete a serious of exercises exploring [order data from Chipotle](https://github.com/TheUpshot/chipotle), compliments of the New York Times's "The Upshot."

For these exercises, you will be conducting basic exploratory data analysis on Chipotle's order data, looking to answer such questions as: 
  - How many orders are being made?
  - What is the average price per order?
  - How many different ingredients? 
  
This process will help you practice your data analysis skills while becoming comfortable with Python (Pandas not required).

## Project Requirements

In a Jupyter Notebook, create working solutions for all of the questions above.

Your notebook should include:

1.
2.
3.

## Submission

Your instructor will explain how to submit your assignment. Typically, this is done either by:

 - Creating a repository in your github profile, hosting your materials, and sharing a link with your instructor. [or]
 - Forking the project repository, adding your solutions, and submitting a pull request back to the relevant repo.
