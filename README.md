## Rubric

For all projects, requirements should be evaluated on a simple point scale of 0, 1, or 2. 

Score | Expectations
:--- | :---
**0** | _Incomplete._
**1** | _Does not meet expectations._
**2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_

## How We Grade Projects

Instructors should use the following guidelines to provide project feedback:

1. Make a copy of the project requirements.
2. Use our rubric to assign students a point value for all required items.
3. Provide at least one comment for each requirement.

> We recommend using a "glow/grow" template, providing one item of praise and one suggestion for improvement for each requirement.
